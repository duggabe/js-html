## How it works

The JavaScript for the GRCon21 Indico website is in file `sponsors.js`. It performs two main functions: (a) generate the footer for every GRCon21 webpage, and (b) generate the Sponsors page. The interface to the Indico software is done using a JavaScript inserted in the basic page template. That script links to the external script located in `https://www.gnuradio.org/indico/sponsors.js`.
